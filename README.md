## üè† Home Automation Blueprint

### 1. **Core Hub Setup**
- Use a **modular MCP server** as your central brain, built with LangGraph and Gemini Flash 2.0.
- Integrate **Node-RED** or **Home Assistant** for flow-based automation and device orchestration.
- Expose secure APIs for remote control via iOS Shortcuts or Swift-based WatchOS apps.

### 2. **Smart Network & Security**
- Build on your **PoE-based Deco router setup**:
  - VLANs for device segregation (e.g., cameras, IoT, guests).
  - Pi-hole for network-wide ad-blocking.
  - Custom firewall rules using Unifi or OPNSense.

### 3. **Room-Level Automation Ideas**
| Room        | Automation Highlights                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Living Room | Voice-controlled lights, ambient music sync, motion-triggered projector |
| Kitchen     | Smart plug for coffee machine, fridge temp monitor with alerts |
| Bedroom     | Sleep tracker integration, AC auto-adjust, sunrise simulation lighting |
| Balcony     | Auto-watering system for plants, bird feeder cam linked to cloud |
| Studio      | Guitar tuner via app, mood lighting presets, noise isolation control |

### 4. **Device Integration**
- Smart switches (Sonoff, Shelly) flashed with **ESPHome**.
- Zigbee/Z-Wave devices via **USB dongle bridge**.
- DIY with Arduino/Pi for things like door sensors or plant hydration monitoring.

### 5. **Automation Rules & Examples**
```yaml
alias: Evening Lights
trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunset
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.living_room
    data: {brightness: 150, color_temp: 350}
```

### 6. **Custom UI & Monitoring**
- Build a personalized dashboard using **Power BI**, integrating device logs and energy usage.
- Host it securely on the MCP server with internal access via SwiftUI app on iPhone/Watch.

### 7. **Future Enhancements**
- Solar panel monitoring via Modbus or API integration.
- AI-generated status videos from camera feeds using your video tools.
- Smart notifications via SMS/Telegram on critical events (intrusion, smoke, etc).
